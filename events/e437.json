The discrepancy in the numbers of the fleet may be explained by the probability that other Jamn privateering vessels joined it after its departure from Port Royal. /Haring [missg] fn 176\n Possibly inc Henry Morgan /v Grainger 67\n Purportedly to help [Bay of Campeachy] logwood-cutter who had been operating there for many years / See Dudley Pope, *Harry Morgan's Way: The Biography of Sir Henry Morgan, 1634-1684* [Lon, Secker & Warburg, 1977], 97 /v Latimer 138",
