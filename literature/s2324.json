      "quote": "[T]here are variations as to the date and the manner in which this [Wallace becoming eponym of Belize] happened. One ver- [start p 74] sion claims that Wallace was with the buccaneers who infested the island of Tortuga (situated to the north of present-day Haiti) until 1638 or 1640, when the French, who had gained the upper hand on this island, expelled him and his followers. Wallace and his comrades then settled at an area vaguely described as around the Bay of Honduras, along the mouth of a river, to which he soon gave his name. Another, somewhat more romantic tale, asserts that Wallace was not really expelled from Tortuga, but was shipwrecked somewhere around the same vaguely defined Bay of Honduras, along the same unnamed river, to which he eventually gave his name. A little-known version claims that Wallace occupied the same vaguely defined area with its unnamed river, having acquired it from a Mosquito (or Miskito) Indian king around the 1680s, apparently by cession. But we have no evidence whatsoever to support any of these theories. [..] Perhaps the most variable feature within the Wallace legend is the suggested date of his settlement, ranging from 1603, 1638, 1640, 1650, and 1662 to 1663 and the 1680s.",
