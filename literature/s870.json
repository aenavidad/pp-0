The capture of Jamaica was followed by settlements in the bay of Campeachy, for the sake of cutting logwood which abounds in the peninsula of [start p 299] Yucatan. These establishments, nourished by a lucrative, though contraband traffic with the neighbouring spaniards, and increased by the buccaneers, when that species of piracy was suppressed, gradually spread along the bay of Honduras and the Mosquito shore.",
