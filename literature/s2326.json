The privateers had previously stolen logwood from Spanish ships to sell in England, where it was used for dyeing cloth in the expanding textile industry (Bolland 1977:25). However, after a 1667 treaty outlawed piracy, privateers began to harvest logwood themselves in coastal areas where logwood grew abundantly, from Campeche down the coast of Yucatan and beyond, extending as far south as the Mosquito Coast in what is now Nicaragua (Dobson 1973:53). The earliest record of logwood cutting in what is now Belizean territory dates to 1705 (Bolland and Shoman 1977:3).",
