Logwood at its best rose to Â£100 per ton, and this very profitable trade soon attracted new settlers, for thirty-three years later, when the inabitants numbered 700, the Governor of Jamaica reported to the King of England that the settlement of Belize 'had increased H.M.'s Customs and the national commerce more than any of H.M's Colonies.'",
