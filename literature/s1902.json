They have used the trade of logwood cutting for about 2 1/2 or 3 years on the coast of Yucatan, from Boca Couil to Cape Catoche, and thence to Cozumel, and during that time the English have had and now have huts and people to the number of 100 or 200 there resident; have never seen any Spaniards or Indians, nor heard of any Indians nearer than 12 or 14 leagues, or Spaniards nearer than Rio Lagartos, 18 leagues off, where there are guards or look-outs, and have never met with any interruption until the pirate Yallahs came about eight months since and took divers vessels. One has also cut wood at Beef Island and Sumasanta, 35 leagues to the westward of Campeachy; the proprietor of Beef Island, who comes there at certain seasons to make hides, has always given leave to the English to cut wood; and the Indians there resident are not subject to the Spaniards. Endorsed by Locke, 'William Coxen and others' depositions concerning cutting logwood 1672.' October 29th to 3rd November 1672.",
