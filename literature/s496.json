Letters of marque were issued, but gentlemen of the stamp of Mr. Wallace, or Wallis, were not wont to be very particular about the nature of their ships' papers in days when they were not likely to be frequently overhauled by our ubiquitous cruisers, and were probably satisfied with the roving commission and immunity from search given them by our national hostility to Spain at that era. [new para] The Bay of Honduras, with its numerous islands and shore inlets, and its protecting reefs—the navigation of which was ticklish work for the clumsy vessels of war of the period, but which they were familiar with—its creeks, lagoons, and river-mouths densely shrouded by tropical foliage, was doubtless early selected by the bold buccaneers as safe retreating-ground whence to retire with the spoils of, and enjoy a respite from, their successful sea-forays.",

Their numbers were soon augmented by fresh arrivals, and extending southwards from Cape Catoche, they in a shore space of time spread as far as the River Belize, and westwards to what appears to have been then called the lake and island of Triste (between Tabasco and the River Campeton), a lagoon with an island in the middle of it. At this time there were two places of rendezvous, or market-places, for the early settlers—the mouth of the Belize River and this island of Triste, adjacent to Campeché.",
