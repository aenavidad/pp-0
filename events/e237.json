    "note": "Colin Steele has shown that this publication marked a definitive turning point from an old to new world focus among the Hakluyt-Purchas corpus, and presented a more comprehensive picture of the Americas in English than had been previously possi- ble. The work was especially strong in natural history and geography, and Steele shows that its timing clearly reflected declining relations with Spain. /v Offen P 19, referencing Colin R. Steele, 'Latin America' in L. E. Pennington [Ed], *The Purchas Handbook: Studies of the Life and Writings of Samuel Purchas, 1577-1626* [Lon, The Hakluyt Society, 1997], vol 1 pp 301-311",
