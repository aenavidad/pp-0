This is call'd the *Logwood* River, the Inhabitants live in Huts on each side of this narrow Creek, near Two hundred *English*, [.. start p lxxxiii] The *English*, who have lived there many years, Cut and Sell it to the Sloops for [..] The *Indians* of this place us'd formerly to Trade with them, but the *English* not keeping ther Faith, but taking and selling them, they are retired up into the Country several Leagues.
