- [x] emailed rod**.historiador@gmail.com[^no reply as of 22 jan 2025]
- [x] no calendar work in ``historical-series-re-Belize/work/apr-24``
- [x] none in ``/oct-23``
- [x] ``/versioning/calendar.tsv`` not filled in
- [x] check ``sheets varids.tsv`` for earliest file w/ calendar
- [x] cartas first pop up in varid 70 ie in 10-30 sep 2021
- [x] check ``pre-git-hist/events.tsv`` for sep 2021
- [x] cartas in ``files/red/rep bz fin pub 1.3_stable *.tsv`` written 7 sep 2021[^seems like a stable ``.numbers`` to ``.tsv`` export so prolly had cartas by 7 sep]
- [x] so cartas first pop up in varid 75 ie by 7 sep[^in `sheets/rep bz fin pub 1.3_stable.tsv`]
- [x] check events again for post-`v-1.4` work[^cartas next touched in `pre-git-hist/files/purp/1638 series *.tsv` on 9 jul 2022, then `purp/PARES-*.txt`, then `purp/1638 cartas *.tsv`, then `yell/data *.tsv` on 27 jul 2022 w last recorded mod on 3 aug 2022]

- [x] split `list.json` for easier handling?[^yes with ``for i in `seq 0 5239`; do jq ".[$i]" list.json > "c$i.json"; done``, plus remove `cartas/list.*` to keep only object files]
- [x] fix `cod` values[^must be `true` if any `data` value is not `null` - done but not rechecked]
- [x] ~~mark `true` for null values of `cod` for cartas de Guat/Mex w/in 15 yrs of 1630[^abort at 1620 as can just navigate by `lbd` value]~~
- [x] add `ref` values to `cat` for easier navigation[^via eg `jq '.cat += {"ref" : "GUATEMALA,39,R.14,N.93"}' c0.json > tmp && mv tmp c0.json`]
- [x] coded 1638 dated records[^checked for thoroughness but not accuracy too - all such files now have non-null `cod` and data in `data` if appropriate, but pre-existing data in `data` not reviewed ie only `false cod` should have null `data`, but `true cod` may have inaccurate or incomplete pre-existing `data`]
- [x] ~~code cartas de gobernadores de Hon/Yuc first?~~
- [x] ~~coded 1639 records~~
- [x] further ensure each 1638 record is calendared w/ summary/extract, either via `cat` or added in `data`[^except records w/c seem irrelevant from `cat` eg geographically irrelevant, and non-digitised records]
- [x] code 1639 records[^fill in any null `cod`, fill in null `mil` for `true cod`, and add record summary in `data` if one in `cat` is weak (for relevant records)]

## 12 feb 2025 onwards[^organised by sections to keep better track of items]
### for pp
- [x] start `pp.tex`[^structure copied from latest `tex` file ie in `historical-series-re-Belize/work/oct-23/`]
- [x] continue pp[^input variables for dates/info relying on `incidents`  or `/literature` data, or estimate them for draft]
- [x] edit copy
- [x] submit preprint[^`pp1` to SocArXiv on 2 mar 2025, plus `pp-0` repo made public on GitHub]
- [x] preprint pubbed[^in SocArXiv on 3 mar 2025]
- [x] requested comments from am*tor@yahoo.com[^on 5 mar 2025, got them on 6 mar 2025]
- [ ] fix vars minor mistakes
    - [ ] can name 'Tipu rebellion' sans capitals[^eg if event is unique to its class (ie no other rebellions in Tipu), and date markers stripped, and synonyms not accepted (eg 'Elizabethan era' properly names but 'Belizean independence' does not)]
    - [ ] general do not recommend deferring to popular senses/meanings of historical concepts eg of *founding*, *settlement*[^maybe only licensed if the proper sense is disputed, or if examined action is of proper sort (eg social/constructed, like marriage or illegal moves in chess, or necessarily intentional, or complex/compound), or if truth value of relevant historical claism turn on sense used, so on, but *not* deference out of respect for agents]
    - [ ] might fix loose definitions/glosses[^if vs only if, qualifiers, so on]
    - [x] note anachronistic use of term *Belize*[^plus maybe make use vs mention explicit, plus maybe note pp does not concern etymology, plus maybe note relevant periodisation (Sp to 1638, Precol to 1862)]
    - [x] add spaces to keywords in metadata
    - [x] note previous reviews/discussions on theories re Bz origins[^for Wallacian theories already noted, plus Bolland, Molina, Ancona, C Quijano, so on, plus maybe add first recognition of problem]
    - [ ] note explicitly why Wallace ought to be read symbolically[^ie why we ought not discard all Wallace theories esp archival ones (eg historian with sources \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) saying 'there was piratical activity near Old in 1630s onwards' and 'Wallace settled Old in 1638' might give a Wallace theory, but if \\(y\\) is apocryphal, but \\(x\\) is not, historian might still sustain a similar theory on \\(x\\) alone)]
    - [x] add `draft` doc class option
    - [x] ~~fix dates~~[^too tricky]
- [ ] get pp into historical prose in `pp2`[^eg as sort of lit rev/historiographic discussion (maybe *only* build Map and modified Log as way of abstracting from vars [theories/models](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/models-science/) in existing lit, to get at the *general* bare bones sans substantive interpretation)]

### recoding cartas
- [x] for all `cod!=null` cartas, ensure `pir` and `def` values accurately reflect criteria as newly specified in `cartas/readme.md`
    - [x] for `pir`, assume this is so[^ie `true` for 'has evidence of piracy, even in just a few words' was the rule followed iirc, with `pir=null` and `mil=true` for similar incidents not obviously piratical (eg foreign ships cruising/watering/wintering/being sighted, foreign sailors/pirates landing/trading, etc) or else `pir` value just ignored on filling in `mil` value]
    - [x] ~~for `def` where `cod=false`, check carta for non-incident defence[^ ie non-incident defence (eg general state of defence, defence proposals, etc) evidenced in *more* than a few words - incident defence already checked as `true` for 'has evidence of *particular* incident (rather than just general defence/proposals), even in few words' was the rule followed to now iirc, with `def=null` and `mil=true` for tricky incidents or else `pir` vlaue just ignored on filling in `mil` value][^3026 hits]~~[^seems like a lot for little return - prolly only might get new coding from non-digitised cartas, as any mention of pir/def in catalogue data usually prompted `cod=true` iirc]

            - [x] for remaining cartas -

                - [x] left `cod=true` with `mil=null` and added `stat=1` for the rest[^2 cartas in Mex post-dating Bacl withdrawal from Bay (as prolly don't need these), and 5 damaged cartas]
- [x] ~~check these cartas against PARES's defence/piracy relations/authorities?~~[^would incl non-Hond def/pir so migth be too much]
### coding missg cartas
- [x] for all years coded in previous log items, ensure no carta is `cod=null`
    - [x] for 1630-1679 dated cartas, exactly 1630-1668 dated cartas mentioned in prev items
        - [x] no `cod=null` in 1630s dated ones
        - [x] none in 1640s
        - [x] none in 1650s
        - [x] none to 1668 inclusive
    - [x] for other cartas, exactly 1601[^in Guat series only] and 1606-1607[^in Guat series only] and 1608-1629 dated cartas mentioned in prev items, but these do have vars `cod=null` cartas
- [x] code missg cartas with `mil` expanded as above
    - [x] for 1601[^find and open via `jq -j '.[] | select(.cat.lbd!=null) | select(.cat.lbd|contains("1601")) | select(.work.cod==null) | "\(.id).json "' temp.json | sed 's/c/open c/'`]
    - [x] for 1606-1607[^but leave `cod=null` for non-Yucn Mex cartas, as 18/19 `mil=true` Mex cartas have 'Yucatán' string in `scope`, and 1/19 has Campeche' instead - so added filer `select(.cat.scope!=null) | select(.cat.scope|contains("Yucat") or contains("Campec"))`]
    - [x] for 1608-1629[^only select Mex cartas as above]
- [x] code 1602-1605 cartas with `mil` as above
    - [x] all in Guat
    - [x] select in Mex[^as above]
- [x] code 1669 cartas as above
    - [x] all in Guat
    - [x] select in Mex
- [x] ~~code 1670s cartas as above~~
    - [x] ~~all in Guat~~
    - [x] ~~select in Mex~~[^prolly not needed after Bacl withdrawal]
- [x] so 1600s to 1660s fully coded[^with 135 `mil=true`]

### cleanup incidents
- [x] restructure `json` files[^for easier data entry]
    - [x] set all `tally` to null,[^add by machine, not by hand]
    - [x] add `incidents` key with empty array value,
    - [x] remove `incident0` objects with all-null values,
    - [x] add `no` key inside incidents objects with matching integ
    - [x] move incidents key-value pairs as just objects to `incidents` array
- [x] get a good incl/excl test for def incidents, or just incl them all with `pir=false`[^keep `incidents/readme.md` conf test (looking for unique, well-sourced, non-compound piracy or defence-against-piracy incidents in Hond Bay in relevant 17th cent year), so for sure exclude defence against non-pirates, excl state of def/def proposals/def orders/genl def stuff, and possibly excl routine/minor def acts (receiving/restocking arms, receiving men)]
    - [x] keep strict `conf` test from `incidents/readme.md`
    - [x] add `possible` array key to all incidents to store acts which may be later discounted
- [x] screen incidents against
    - [x] events to ensure all events cited and all incidents extracted
        - [x] all cited
            - [x] ~~main hits[^88 `cod!=false` hits]~~
            - [x] duplicates - set `cod=null`[^4 `cod=false` and `cod_n!=null` hits]
            - [x] main hits - all cited[^92 `cod!=false` hits w duplicates now]
        - [x] all needed ~~info~~ acts extracted to incidents[^~~seems not needed if event is cited~~ possibly some previously excluded acts could go in `possible` array - all info from events not needed though]
            - [x] sort some existing acts into `possible`[^eg arrival of reinforcements]
            - [x] for 1600s[^and added duplicate event ids]
            - [x] for 1610s
            - [x] for 1620s
            - [x] for 1630s

    - [x] ~~published lit cited in events to get cleaner incidents~~[^rely on text in events files, or do later]
    - [x] cartas to ensure all incidents extracted and to get cleaner incidents[^did not input vars `possible` acts eg sending arms]
        - [x] for 1601

        - [x] 1650s
        - [x] 1660s
        - [x] the rest[^only had some 1680s cartas]
- [x] ~~make sure acts in `incidents` are exactly ones to tally~~[^do after draft]
- [ ] comb through incidents again to check:
    - [ ] all def acts are `pir=false`
    - [ ] no def act has embedded pir acts[^but pir ones allowed to have embedded def ones]
    - [ ] pir acts are bundled consistently
        - [ ] geographically[^Bay Isl vs Rattan, Amatique vs G Dulce, Omoa vs Pto Caballos, etc]
        - [ ] by type[^cruise during raid vs sans raid, etc]

### cleanup citations[^for easier lit review/data]
- [x] assign ids[^keep `.v-1.4_id`, keep *lower* `.v-1.4_id` in case record has > 1 of same odd/even type, plus assign odd ids > 583 for deposited series or collections, and even > 1628 else - assigned 7 odds s585 to s597, and 342 evens s1630 to s2312]
- [x] get all records into `/citations`[^ought to have 1567 records (460 harv, 1107 v-1.4), but got 1456 (349 harv, 1107 v-1.4)- so 111 harv duplicate overwritten by their v-1.4 sources (as v-1.4 extracted after harv)]
- [x] ~~get urls, old short cites into single arrays~~

- [x] ~~delete/merge duplicates~~[^currently 109 harv—v1.4 duplicates in `citations.json` (with only their v-1.4 copies in `/citations`) and 1 triplicate in `citations.json` (`s526`)]
    - [x] recover `citations/s526.json` triplicate[^had 2 harv copies, 1 v-1.4 copy in `citations.json` - copied missing copies to `citations/s526.json` in invalid structure]
    - [x] copy missing harv records for 109 duplicates
    - [x] all harv and v-1.4 copies from `citations.json` now in `/citations`
