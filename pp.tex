\section{Model}
\label{s:model}
Let \(s\) be S~Bay, \(w\) W~Bay, \(n\) N~Bay, \(\to\) the historical \mention{lead to} relation, \(t_{i}\) a point in time, \(\pir(i)\) the use of place \(i\) as a pirate haven, \(\log(i)\) of \(i\) as a logging camp, \(\own(i)\) the thinking of place \(i\) as one's own. Say \(\pir(s)\) at \(t_{0}\) and \(\own(s)\) at \(t_{1}\) and \(\log(w)\) at \(t_{i}\) and \(\own(w)\) at \(t_{j}\).\footnote{Where \mention{S Bay} is the southern Bay of Honduras and Spanish ports there (Truxillo, Pto Caballos, Sto Tomas, etc) and waters off this coast and these ports to distance from which pirates could spy on ports and shipping lanes (ie incl Bay Isl and cayes off Toledo), \mention{W Bay} is similarly defined but for western Hond Bay and ports and lanes there (Tamalcab for Bacalar ie incl cayes off Belize, Corozal), \mention{N Bay} is similarly defined but for northern Hond Bay and ports and lanes there (Valladolid's port and Yucn Channel ie incl Cozumel probably).}

%
% model 1
\begin{model}
Say \(\pir(s)\to\log(w)\) at \(t_{k}\) for \(1\leq k\). % ie log(w) at t_{k}
Then buccaneers thought of \(\pir(s)\to\log(w)\) as an expansion of their territory. Call their resulting territory \mention{Bay} and let \(b\) be it. % ie Bay came about at t_{k}
Then at and after \(t_{k}\), they \(\own(b)\) since \(t_{1}\).
\end{model}
%
%
% model 2
\begin{model}
Say \(\pir(s)\to\log(w)\) at \(t_{k}\) for \(1\not\leq k\). % ie log(w) at t_{k} before own(s)
Then buccaneers did \emph{not} think of \(\pir(s)\to\log(w)\) as an expansion of their territory. So \(\pir(s)\to\log(w)\) did not result in an expansion of territory.
\end{model}
%
%
% model 3
\begin{model}
Say \(\pir(s)\not\to\log(w)\) at any \(t_{k}\). % eg via shipwreck, settled intentionally, 'lead to' indirectly rather than directly
\end{model}
%
%
Then we probably want to claim and show that Model 1 is more fitting than 2 or 3. % prolly is just a refinement on existing published lit
Further, we may want to sketch out responses for `When was Belize settled or founded?'% ie from permanent settlement, from whenever buccaneers/Baymen thought they owned it, from first stay at in Bz during wet season (w/o logging), etc
