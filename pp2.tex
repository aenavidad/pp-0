\section{Introduction}
\label{s:intro}
	The origins of Belize have been an open problem in historical literature since at least the 18th century, and remain so today, with over two dozen theories proposed so far, and little consensus to boot.%
	\footnote{Belize is the only pirate settlement in the Caribbean, and only logwood settlement, to have survived past the 19th century. As such, it is the only country in the Americas for which this problem is open. \emph{All} pirate or logwood settlements seem to have unclear origins though, including at least the Bay Islands, Campeachy, Catoche, the Mosquito Shore, and Tortuga. The preceding uniqueness claim has previously been made in literature for the same or smaller comparison classes. The generality claim has prior been made for at least some pirate or logwood settlements, but seems to hold for all of them. Theories for Belize listed in Table~\ref{tab:literature}. Note this table is not a systematic literature review, and further note we claim only that given readings are possible or acceptable. All data for this paper deposited at \url{https://github.com/aenavidad/pp-0/}. In particular, Table~\ref{tab:literature} data in \href{https://github.com/aenavidad/pp-0/tree/main/literature}{\nolinkurl{/literature}}.}

	This paper seeks to either complicate or clarify matters by presenting existing and possible understandings of the problem in Section~\ref{s:problem}, representations of the historical record in Section~\ref{s:models}, and theories in Section~\ref{s:theories}.%
	\footnote{For appropriately qualified (not strict) \ment{existing} or \ment{possible} understandings or representations or theories, eg historically-relevant, non-trivial, seemingly viable, so on. In this paper, we naively imagine or sketch historical reasoning as first taking a problem, then carving or refining it into well-specified questions, then representing or modelling the historical record, and finally using this model to answer the posed questions, where such answers hold \emph{for} the questions as so specified and \emph{for} the model as so built. We claim only that this is a possible or acceptable naive sketch, not that it is uniquely so, nor that this is \emph{actually} how historians have previously tackled the problem of the origins of Belize. We think the naive sketch might help to get a grip of the problem, make sense of current discordance in literature, or see and fill in gaps therein. This paper uses the name \ment{Belize} anachronistically, and does \emph{not} regard the related but distinct problem of the \emph{name's} origins. The problem at hand seems to have been first noted by \cite{alm26}*{p~5} (implicitly), first discussed by \cite{nun77}*{pp~6--9, 12--14} (obliquely), and most recently discussed by \citelist{\cite{bul16} \cite{cam09} \cite{res19}}.} % may add note re weak vs strong empircal claims made for problem/models/theories

\section{Problem}
\label{s:problem}
	In this section, we characterise the problem in Section~\ref{ss:carving}, as it is currently \emph{and} as it may possibly be understood, and note some salient features in Section~\ref{ss:features}.%
	\footnote{The carving given here is not fully realised, but seems straightforward and useful enough as is. No uniqueness (`this is the \emph{only} carving available') claim made. A weak empirical claim \emph{is} made though, ie that the given carving \emph{is} how at least some historians understand the problem, modulo our possible or acceptable readings of literature. No strong empirical (`this is \emph{actually} how most historians have previously carved') claims made.}

	\subsection{Carving}
	\label{ss:carving}
		Let \ment{Honduras} be the earliest predecessor state of modern Belize, and say it first emerged or came to be at some time \(t_{\og}\).\footnote{\ment{Bay} also appropriate here.} Then Belize did \emph{not} exist at any time before \(t_{\og}\), and \emph{did} exist at least at some times after \(t_{\og}\).\footnote{Allowing for state discontinuity.} In which case, we say the problem of the origins of Belize is a class of questions pertinent to this happening or process.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg class is non-empty and finite, questions are direct or non-embedded and immediately or straightforwardly pertinent, so on. We imagine the pertinent questions are at least `What is Honduras?,' `Where is Honduras?,' `When is \(t_{\og}\)?,' and `How did Honduras come to be at \(t_{\og}\)?' Call these the \ment{What}, \ment{Where}, \ment{When}, \ment{How} questions of the problem.}
		And a theory for this problem is a class of answers to those questions.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg class has an answer for each required question, answers are immediate or direct, so on.}
	%
	%
	% subsec problem features
	\subsection{Features}
	\label{ss:features}
		We note this carving requires at least concepts of \ment{state} and their emergence and continuity and succession, but does not specify them. To that extent, it is barely realised, and so remains open to a number of distinct senses or specifications of these concepts.%
		\footnote{We mainly have in mind here existing or possibly useful senses. These are at least the spatiotemporal vs collective vs corporate state, small vs large state, intentional vs accidental emergence of state, continuous vs discontinuous state, and voluntary vs involuntary discontinuity of state.}
	
		Further, let a \ment{vague} problem be one where, given a \emph{complete} historical record, at least some of the particular senses of the required concepts give us discordant theories.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg record is relevant, discordance is significant, so on. The idea being that the historical record itself might not straightforwardly close the problem for us. Examples of non-vague (closed) problems are those of the origins of Virginia and St Kitt's \& Nevis. Regardless of what we mean by \ment{state}, \ment{state emergence}, so on, theories for those problems invariably agree on the relevant happenings and date them to 1607 and 1623, respectively. In contrast, theories for a vague problem would \emph{not} so invariably agree (unless trivially).}
		Then we say the problem at hand is vague.%
		\footnote{Further, say the problem's vagueness is \ment{artificial} if the non-extant historical record would dissolve the vagueness, and say it is \ment{inherent} if it would not. Then we say the problem might even be \emph{inherently} vague. We note the problem seems to be vague and possibly inherently so for all pirate or logwood settlements. The preceding vagueness claim has previously been made in literature for at least some of these polities.}
		Further, let a \ment{minimal} theory be one which does \emph{not} presuppose or fix particular senses of the required concepts.\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg has no trivial answers, so on.} Then we say we currently have very few minimal theories for the problem at hand.%
		\footnote{These might be desireable, given the current glut of maximal theories in literature, ie of theories which \emph{do} presuppose or fix particular senses of the required concepts. Arguably though, the historian's job \emph{is} to provide such maximal theories and say `these are the senses we ought to use for this problem.' In which case, we might at least want \emph{transparent} theories, eg ones which flag the senses in use, give us reasons to accept their proffered senses, to reject competing ones, or at least which note competing senses exist. Then we say we do not seem to have very many transparent theories in literature either.}

\section{Models}
\label{s:models}
	In this section, we represent or model the relevant, extant historical record, as it is currently \emph{and} as it may possibly be modelled, spatially in Section~\ref{ss:spatial}, and temporally in Section~\ref{ss:temporal}.%
	\footnote{No uniqueness claim made. A weak empirical claim \emph{is} made, ie that the given models \emph{are} how at least some current theories in literature represent the historical record (modulo our possible or acceptable readings of literature). We mainly have in mind theories which seem viable, but do not mean to discard any from the outset. Wallacian theories pose a difficulty here, given their popularity (cf Table~\ref{tab:literature}) and at least partial unfoundedness. \citelist{\cite{cam09}*{pp~72--110} \cite{bul16}*{pp~137--151} \cite{res19}*{pp~19--24}} have thankfully shown Wallace is most likely apocryphal. We do \emph{not} disregard such theories on this basis, however (though we \emph{do} end up disregarding most of them later on, for a distinct but related reason), as we imagine the following might be the case for at least some of them. Say some historian carefully reviewed the relevant archives, and concluded from this that there was heightened piratical activity in the Bay of Honduras in the mid-third of the 17th century, followed by increasingly significant logging activity in the last third of the same. And say they then came across some work claiming Wallace landed and stayed on the Old River in 1638. Then they might just give us a Wallacian theory, but the Wallace portion therein would \emph{not} be necessary, such that if the aforementioned work later proved unfounded, we might simply excise it from the theory, eg by ignoring biographical details, and reading \ment{Wallace} symbolically ie as \ment{one of the first Baymen}. We think this ought to be done, eg for Meridian theories, including \citelist{\cite{fen49}*{p~3} \cite{car71}*{pp~55, 210} \cite{car78}*{pp~260--261} \cite{anc78}*{pp~370--376} \cite{pen69}*{pp~217--219}}, modulo the non-zero chance of unique, non-extant primary sources in Merida in and after the 18th century. This is to say, we do \emph{not} think Wallace's being apocryphal (by itself) significantly pares down the number of viable theories in literature, nor restricts the number of possible ones (eg as in \cite{bul16}*{pp~137--138, 145, 151--156}). Further, as charges of dishonesty in Wallacian theories by \citelist{\cite{bul16}*{pp~138, 140--141} \cite{cam09}*{pp~87--88, 105--106} \cite{res19}*{pp~23--24}} regard \ment{Wallace} properly (not symbolically) read, they are likewise disregarded here (though we agree that almost all of them are ideologically biased).}
	
	We start by listing happenings or phenomena (and relations among them) commonly represented in literature.%
	\footnote{To see what parts of the record are or are not deemed relevant.}
	We find that the most common are piracy and logging, where the former (somehow) led to the latter.%
	\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg \ment{piracy} by resident or non-resident Dutch or English or Frenchmen, \ment{logging} of any dyewood or of only logwood, so on. Most (but not all) existing theories seem to represent \emph{both} phenomena \emph{and} the relation. Further, only phenomena or relations related to these three seem common in literature, eg social or legal pressures for or against piracy, so on. A notable class of existing theories which sometimes do not represent all three are \ment{normative} theories where agents simply land and immediately settle and found a state in some given year. Incidentally (or unsurprisingly), most Wallacian theories seem to be normative ones. We owe this class to \cite{cam11}*{pp~95--96}, who credits xx (but do not import the intentional vs accidental distinction).}
	So models must represent at least these two phenomena and one relation.%
	\footnote{Spatially, it looks like we only need to consider piracy, as it seems to subsume logging, while the relation does not seem to be so extended. Temporally, we consider all three.}
	%
	%
	% subsec spatial models
	\subsection{Spatial}
	\label{ss:spatial}
		We seem to need only one spatial model, namely, \ref{eqn:map}.%
		\footnote{The Bay and Atlantic surroundings (up to some 800--900 nautical miles from centroid) mapped from northwest to southeast. For vertices as places, and edges as a certain relation among them. }
		% eqn map
		\begin{equation}
		\tag{Map}
		\label{eqn:map}
		\begin{tikzcd}[arrows=dash]
		\nt &\bc \rar \ar[rr,bend left] &\mt \rar &\id &\et
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation}
	
		We start by listing places (and their relations) commonly represented in literature.%
		\footnote{For places, Bacalar ie north-central Belize and the Bay Islands in the Bay, plus Campeachy (including Terminos and Tris), Catoche (including Cozumel and possibly Ascension), Jamaica, south-central Mosquito Shore, Old Providence, and Tortuga (including north-west Hispaniola) outside of it. For relations, distance.}
		And note that these seem to be places in or about the Bay of Honduras which pirates are thought to have frequented at least in the 17th century.%
		\footnote{For simplicity, we say all these places are pirate haunts, and further say all logging stands were pirate haunts. The former is arguably so, whereas the latter is sort of expected if piracy led to logging. We may build a similar \ref{eqn:map} without saying so though.}
		In which case, we map \emph{all} such haunts in or about the Bay, and \emph{all} pertinent relations among them.%
		\footnote{And so map all logging stands too. Strictly though, the historical record \emph{possibly} overlooks minor haunts (infrequent, visited only by few, so on), and \emph{likely} does so for logging stands (minor, far-flung, so on). The reconstructed natural habitat of dyewoods might help a bit with the latter.}
	
		\subsubsection{Places}
		For haunts outside of the Bay, we note that the only mode of transport we need here is maritime, and the only maritime entrances to the Bay are via the north or east.\footnote{For simplicity, counting north-east entrance via the Caymans as via east.} So, we might simply map these as \(\nt\) and \(\et\) in \ref{eqn:map}, respectively, and count these as proxies for all such haunts.
	
		For haunts inside the Bay, we have no such proxies, so we check this by hand, and find we may want to add to Bacalar and the Bay Islands only one further place, namely, the mouth of the Bay.%
		\footnote{We assume this hand check was thorough enough. For the Bay bound from Catoche to Gracias a Dios (rather than Ascension or Espiritu Santo to Camaron), the only other places we might possibly add are Valladolid (from Ascension to Catoche including islands) to the north or north Mosquito Shore (from Camaron to Gracias including cayes) to the east, but these showed up too infrequently. The Bay Islands seem to widely be recognised as a pirate haunt in literaure (and works on piracy), with Bacalar less so (and infrequently in works on piracy), and the mouth of the Bay almost never (even in works on piracy). If we identify haunts empirically (from piratical activity), then the mouth seems to have been more active than Bacalar, such that it ought to be deemed one if the latter is. If we instead identify haunts strategically, then the mouth seems a likelier haunt than Bacalar and even the Bay Islands. For strategic identification, say pirates frequented places from which they could readily spy on shipping ports, and say this was especially so for major rather than minor ports. Then all the Bay's major ports (Puerto Caballos, Santo Tomas, Golfo Dulce) were in its mouth, so none could be readily spied on from Bacalar nor the Bay Islands, whereas they all could from the mouth itself (including cayes). Piratical activity is plotted in Figure~\ref{fig:piracyinbay}, as gleaned from literature (for all years) and the Guatemala and Mexico series in the Archivo General de Indias (to 1669 inclusive). For this figure, note the review process very likely missed some literature and records, and further note incidents do not seem consistently carved out, and further include some defence incidents, and ones dubiously deemed piratical. Figure~\ref{fig:piracyinbay} data in \href{https://github.com/aenavidad/pp-0/tree/main/incidents}{\nolinkurl{/incidents}}, with a tally and partial calendar of defence related records in \href{https://github.com/aenavidad/pp-0/tree/main/cartas}{\nolinkurl{/cartas}} (not plotted).}
		So, we map these as \(\bc\), \(\id\), and \(\mt\) in \ref{eqn:map}, respectively.%
		\footnote{So \ref{eqn:map} has all pirate haunts (and so all logging stands) in or about the Bay.}
		% fig pirate activity in bay
		\input{ppfigpir} % \label{fig:piracyinbay} - may split bars into Mt/Bc/Id/rest-of-Bay colours
	
		\subsubsection{Relations}
		For relevant relations among haunts, we seem to only need cost (of maritime transport) from place to place.%
		\footnote{Possibly missing minor relations. Cost naturally subsumes distance, but additionally expense, labour, know-how, so on. No non-cost relations seem immediately relevant.}
		So say some place is \ment{close} to another if it is \emph{not} costly to get from one to the other and vice versa.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg for a given cost measure, for a given affordable-costly threshold, so on. Though cost is naturally directed and weighted, we make closeness undirected and unweighted for simplicity, and further ignore self-closeness for the same.}
		Then we say \(\bc\), \(\mt\), and \(\id\) are all close to each other, while \(\nt\) and \(\et\) are close to none, and add to \ref{eqn:map}.%
		\footnote{So \ref{eqn:map} has all pertinent relations among mapped places.}
	%
	%
	% subsec temporal models
	\subsection{Temporal}
	\label{ss:temporal}
		We seem to need a few temporal models, namely, \ref{eqn:logs}.%
		\footnote{For space restricted to in and about the Bay, per \ref{eqn:map}. For vertices as points in time, and arcs as series of happenings or events through time (allowing loops for \(t_i\leq t_j\) where \(t_i=t_j\)). Labelled arcs represent a certain series of events, while unlabelled ones represent any such series. \ref{eqn:logs} are a bit trickier than \ref{eqn:map}.}
		% eqn logs
		\begin{equation}
		\tag{Logs}
		\label{eqn:logs}
		\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=tiny]
		(1) &t_0 \rar &t_{\og} \rar &t_1\\
		(2) &t_0 \rar &t_{\buc} \rar &t_{\ct} \rar &t_1\\
		(3) &t_0 \rar &t_{\ct} \rar &t_{\buc} \rar &t_1\\
		(4) &t_i \rar \ar[rr,bend right,"a_j"] &t_{\ct} \rar &t_k
		\end{tikzcd}
		\end{equation}
		
		We start by listing temporal points (and their relations) commonly represented in literature.%
		\footnote{For points (other than \(t_{\og}\)), the start and end of piracy (loose or tight bounds, \ment{piracy} variously understood, only or not only in the Bay, so on), start of logging (loose or tight bounds, \ment{logging} variously understood, only or not only in the Bay, so on), and start or end of various phenomena (or appearance or disappearance of various states of affairs) bearing on piracy or logging (mostly tight bounds, mostly not only in Bay, so on), including social, legal, commercial, or military pressures for or against piracy or logging. For relations (other than \ment{lead to}), \ment{encourage to} and \ment{discourage from}. For this hand check, we disregard theories which do not represent piracy as leading to logging. This class includes most normative theories, and so includes most Wallacian ones. Temporal models for these would seem to be pretty straightforward in any case, eg just a point in time. Further though, we agree with xx (and most recent literature, it would seem) that normative theories seem to be the least viable ones available. The reason for this stance is sometimes given as historians' having found no record of such an act despite having looked for it since at least the 19th century. But the act may not have been recorded in the first place, or if it was, the native record would have almost \emph{surely} been lost or destroyed, so this does not strictly seem like a particularly good reason for the stance. On the other hand, we note that the act, if it took place, would have \emph{possibly} entered oral tradition. And we \emph{do} have a few 17th and 18th century sources where mention of such an act would have been crucial or at least pertinent, even with reference to tradition, and where we nonetheless find no such notice. \emph{This} absence seems like a stronger reason for the stance, and is the one we give (though strictly this only establishes that the act \emph{possibly} did not take place, unless we say the act \emph{more than} possibly would have entered tradition).} % may add gloss of tight vs loose bounds
		And note that these seem to be bounds of piracy or logging or related phenomena or states of affairs near or about \(t_{\og}\).%
		\footnote{Or near or about the bounds of piracy or logging.}
		In which case, we plot \emph{only} the bounds of piracy and logging, and \emph{only} the \ment{lead to} relation.%
		\footnote{Plus \(t_{\og}\), plus a further relation needed for \ment{lead to}. We do not plot related phenomena nor states of affairs (nor their \ment{encourage to} nor \ment{discourage from} relations) for simplicity, and because current evidence in literature does not really give us a clear picture of them nor their relations, such that their relevance is also not very clear. For instance, it is possible for commercial pressures to have had much more of a bearing on piracy or logging than legal or military ones, and vice versa, but we have not really come across solid evidence for nor against either possibility (despite the latter one seemingly being more often than not presumed in literature, judging by how often legal or military pressures are cited, as compared to commercial ones). Further, almost all of these would seem to more naturally fit a graded (as phenomena) rather than binary (as states of affairs) representation (despite the latter being more common in literature). That said, we might still end up with similar (but messier) \ref{eqn:logs} if we plotted them.}
		
		\subsubsection{Bounds} % non-bound points not needed
		For outer bounds, we fix the lower bound as that of the earlier phenomenon (piracy), and upper bound as that of the later one (logging), and plot in \ref{eqn:logs} as  \(t_0\) and \(t_1\), respectively.%
		\footnote{For appropriate phenomenal bounds, eg loose lower and tight upper ones, say 1520s to 1720s for piracy and 1590s to 1770s for logging. If we imagine piratical and logging activity as bell curves, then we seem to need the left tail ends wholly contained in our models, but not so much the right tail ends.}
		Then for all existing and at least some possible \(t_{\og}\), we ought to and do have \(t_0 \leq t_{\og} \leq t_1\).%
		\footnote{Existing \(t_{\og}\) range from 1550s to 1710s. Possible \(t_{\og}\) range further to 1780s or 1800s or 1860s (for continuous collective state or large collective state or large corporate state, respectively, ie uninterrupted settlement or multiple settlements or multiple governance levels). So this restricts possible carvings of (and so possible theories for) the problem.}
		
		For inner bounds, we need only the upper bound of piracy, and lower bound of logging. But as these are and may be variably understood, let \ment{buccaneering} and \ment{cutting} be subclasses of piracy and logging, respectively.%
		\footnote{For either strict or non-strict subclasses, eg piracy by only certain vs any agents, logging of only logwood vs any dyewoods, so on.}
		Then we fix the upper bound of buccaneering and lower bound of cutting \emph{in} the Bay, and plot in \ref{eqn:logs} as \(t_{\buc}\) and \(t_{\ct}\), respectively.%
		\footnote{For either loose or tight bounds. We restrict bounds to the Bay for simplicity, and feel this is licensed as all existing and most possible \(t_{\og}\) likewise mark an event or happening in the same. This disallows a spatially discontinuous state though, so further restricts possible carvings and theories. Note a good number of existing theories consider \emph{both} loose and tight lower bounds for cutting (ie light vs heavy or sporadic vs frequent cutting).}
		
		\subsubsection{Paths} % no need to mention/consider literature/piracy/logging
		For the relation, say some phenomenon \ment{finely} leads to another if most of the latter's earlier incidents are incidents of the former too.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg for temporally tight but spatially loose incident bounds, for some early-late threshold, so on. We mean to count as single incidents cases where buccaneers first set out to plunder in one place but then end up cutting in another (say because they found so no ships to surprise in the first), so on. There are ways of getting at this concept which do not rely so much on careful carving of incidents, eg in terms of closeness and coincidence, so on.}
		And say they \ment{tightly} track each other in some given period of time if their incidence curves therein are similar and very temporally close.%
		\footnote{Appropriately qualified, eg for incidence plotted only across time, for naive similarity (curves roughly having the same shape), for some temporal closeness threshold (few months or years), so on. Further, say they \ment{loosely} track each other in some period if their curves therein are similar but not temporally close.}
		And lastly distinguish \ment{gainful} from \ment{lossy} buccaneering.%
		\footnote{For some appropriate profitable-unprofitable theshold, eg as determined by agents vs empirically, gross vs net, so on. We need this to split buccaneering into disjoint subphenomena. If we set a minimal empirical threshold (eg \ment{gainful} if buccaneers got at least one penny's worth of booty, else \ment{lossy}), then we note that the historical record almost exclusively offers a picture of gainful buccaneering only (strictly speaking), this being especially so for buccaneering in the Bay (given our near complete reliance on Spanish sources for it). Loosely speaking, we would have a proxy picture of lossy buccaneering for some given period if it tightly tracked gainful buccaneerring therein (straightforwardly) and if they loosely tracked (given their temporal order and distance). For Spanish records, we note their tendency to label any foreigner \ment{pirate} (inflating gainful buccaneering incidence), and the likely or possible chance of their missing certain gainful buccaneering incidents (deflating incidence) eg later or minor ones (by victims' being desensitised), ones during heightened buccaneering activity (being overwhelmed), so on, where the inflation is easy to correct, but the deflation not so much.}
		Then for buccaneering and cutting \emph{in} the Bay, lossy buccaneering either did or did not finely lead to cutting, and either did or did not tightly track gainful buccaneering near or about \(t_{\ct}\).%
		\footnote{We restrict paths to the Bay as \(t_{\ct}\) was so restricted. For buccaneering and cutting in or out of the Bay, both gainful buccaneering's finely leading to cutting and its not tightly nor loosely tracking lossy buccaneering (in some appropriate period) do not seem viable. A notable class of theories which do not represent lossy buccaneering in the Bay as finely leading to cutting in the Bay are those where only too few of the early cutting incidents were buccaneering ones too, or where most were but only outside the Bay.} % may not need to note order of peaks for tight/loose tracking - may note gain bucc is multimodal distrib and we imagine loss bucc is so too - may note reasons for unviability claims
		So we fix four paths near or about \(t_{\ct}\), and plot in \ref{eqn:logs} as \(a_k\). % may fix a_fl for finely lead (yes/no) and a_tt for tightly track (yes/no)
