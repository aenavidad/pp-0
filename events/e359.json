    "note": "an English adventurer [probably Capt. Fload /Haring [missg] fn 98 /313-314 CSPC 1], some time after the Spanish descent of 1638 [on few Frenchmen settled at Tortuga], gathered a body of 300 of his compatriots in the island of Nevis near St. Kitts, and sailing for Tortuga dispossessed the few Frenchmen living there of the island. According to French accounts he was received amicably by the inhabitants and lived with them for four months, when he turned upon his hosts, disarmed them and marooned them upon the opposite shore of Hispaniola. /v Haring 63 /Charlevoix lib 7 pp 10-12 / See *Mémoire envoyé aux seigneurs de la CIA par M. de Poincy, 15 Nov 1640* [Saint Domingue et Paris, P. de Vaissière, 1909], Appendix I /v [missg]\n By the end of 1639, ... [Tortuga] was occupied by some 300 inhabitants, mainly Eng, but with a large admixture of Frenchmen /Newton 280 [cites partially Egerton MS 2395 f 508 / Charlevoix lib 3 p 7]\n [After French Capture in 1640] the English [were] expelled /Newton 280, and sailed away to Prov /v Haring 64 /Charlevoix lib 7 pp 10-12\n Charlevoix calls this man [Pres James] Willis ... Providence records repeatedly give the leader's name as Pres James. His real name may have been William James for Charlevoix's spelling of English names is very erratic, e.g. Waemaerd for Warner /Newton 281 fn 10\n [T]henceforward Tortuga remained in French hands [despite Sp attacks in 1643, 1654] /Newton 282 = the coming of Levasseur the French had gradually elbowed them [Eng previously at Tortuga] out of the island, and compelled them either to retire to the Lesser Antilles or to prey upon their Spanish neighbours /v Haring 78",
