This is a mistake. There is no difficulty whatever in tracing the occupations of the British in the Bay of Honduras to their origin, and this I will now proceed to do.",

That they had many a hard tussle for these possessions with the few inhabitants who were scattered over the uncleared tracts between the limits above mentioned, and that much unjustifiable violance, and many deeds of rapine and savage cruelty were committed, there is little doubt: but that they succeeded in firmly planting themselves on the soil there is as little.",
