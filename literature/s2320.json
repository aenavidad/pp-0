Although we cannot be precise about dates since, of necessity, they initially established their 'hegemony' by stealth, nevertheless, we know that they began to use this and other islands along the Belizean coast as their hiding places probably from as early as the mid 1550s, that is, begore they established more permanent settlements. [... start p 179] Fromt he mid 1550s, nearly 150 years before Hariza, Spanish officials in this region had complained bitterly of their frustrations in attempting to dislodge what they then called the 'English Lutheran corsairs' or the 'heretical Lutherans'. They complained that when they gave chase, the British would invariably retreat to their strategic havens like Cay Casina where the clumsy Spanish ships 'dared not follow'.",
