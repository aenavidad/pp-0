      "quote": "The origins of the British Settlement in the Bay of Honduras are obscure, some historians suggesting a settlement on the Cockscomb Coast in the south during the early 1630s,[1] others claiming it was founded about 1638 or 1640 by a Captain Wallice or Willis a the mouth of the Belize River.[2] The latter idea dates back, at least, to the Honduras Almanacks of 1827 and 1839,[3] though the 1829 Almanack states that the first British settlement was established from Jamaica in 1638. Since Jamaica was not British until 1655, that hypothesis has as little credibility as the others. Whatever the details, which will probably remain in doubt because of the paucity of early records, the purpose of the British settlement was to export logwood, a tree from which a dye valued by the [start p 55] woolen industry was obtained.[1]",

      "quote": "By the middle of the seventeenth century British buccaneers, who had previously plundered Spanish logwood ships, were engaged in cutting the tree themselves in various parts of the Yucatán peninsula, particularly in Campeche in the Gulf of Mexico. The suppression of privateering that occurred after the Treaty of Madrid in 1667 encouraged the shift from buccaneering and raiding to logwood cutting and settlement. In 1670, Governor Modyford of Jamaica informed Lord Arlington that there were 'about a dozen logwood vessels formerly privateers, selling the wood at £25 and £50 a ton and making a great profit; and that they go to places uninhabited or inhabited only be Indians.'",
