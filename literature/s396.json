      "quote": "Our knowledge of the locations and of the towns on New River and the upper Belize River is drawn from the account [by Cogolludo] of Fuensalida's journeys in 1618 and 1641. He [Fuensalida] calls New River 'RÃ­o de Dzuluinicob' (literally, 'river of the foreign men'), which, he says, meant 'river of the Spaniards,' and indeed Dzul is what the Maya called the Spaniards. J. E. S. Thompson ([personal] communication) suggests [that said toponym might rather or further indicate] the presence of early British logwood cutters, which seems very possible. On the Usumacinta River, however, the Dzul were certain enemies of the Maya Chontal. Their leader had a Mexican name, and they were presumably Nahuatl-speaking inhabitants of Tabasco. Since the remains at Santa Rita near the mouth of the New River display marked Mexican [non-Maya] characteristics, I suggest that the river's Maya name goes back to pre-Spanish times.",
