He is generally believed to have established a small camp or base at the mouth of a river in what is now British Honduras sometime during the year 1640. His exact motives for choosing this location are not a matter of record. In view of the fact that the extensive backswamps on either side of this river contained vast quantities of logwood, it seems likely that he arrived there on a cutting expedition. His name was given both to the settlement and the river, being progressively corrupted to VALLIS and finally BELIZE.",
