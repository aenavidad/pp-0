The Jamaican governor Modyford's 1672 list of the principal British logwood works includes 'Cape Catoche, Cozumell, Champatone, Port Real and St. Paulo,' but does not mention Belize [Burdon 1 p 2]. There were no doubt many Englishmen passing along this coast, obtaining food from the sea, fresh water from the mainland, [start p 22] protection from Spanish guarda costas in the multitude of secluded cays, rivers, and remote backwaters that would allow one to careen a vessel or await a passing merchant ship that might become the next prize.",

Though the life of a wood cutter at this time is well documented as being a transient one [e.g., John Masefield ed, Dampier's voyages : two voyages to Campeachy, in 2 vols, reprint of 1717 ed, London: E Grant Richards, 1906], at least some of the mariners remained as settlers, since in 1705, 'the River of Bullys' was described as the primary point of lading for English logwood ships [Burdon 1 p 60]. Though the numbers are unrecorded, the year 1717 must have seen a large influx of settlement when the logwood cutters were driven out of the Bay of Campeche.",

The mysterious pirate Wallis (also Willis, Wallice, Wallace, and in Spanish, Valis) who, according to many sources was supposed to have given his name to the modern nation [C Quijano p 46; Dobson, History of Belize, London: Longman Caribbean, 1973, cf p 50], was likely never at Belize. The legend of settlement at the Belize River mouth by English mariners as early as the 1630s has persisted since at least the early nineteenth century [Bridges 2 p 134]. No actual corroborating historical evidence is known to exist, however, and there seems to be little likelihood that any will be turned up at this late date.",

[new para] English pirates regularly attacked Spanish settlements around the Laguna de Terminos in the Bay of Campeche during the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, often carrying away cut logwood that they found in warehouses and in ships. Eventually, by 1662, English mariners began settling at 'Campeachy' [Campeche], cutting logwood for export to Europe via Jamaica and New England [Thornton 1953 article 'The English at Campeachy 1670-82' in Jamaican Hist Rev vol 2 issue 3 pp 27-38, cf p 27].",

Seventeen historical-period sites were located and investigated through surface collection in the New River valley, many of which related to slave-based mahogany extraction. Excavations were undertaken at two Belize River valley locales: THE BARCADARES was an early eighteenth-century community of independent logwood-cutting mariners, and is the earliest identified British settlement in Belize; CONVENTION TOWN was a community of slave-owning wood cutters who evacuated the Mosquito Shore in 1787. /v Finamore p vi\n Survey and excavation maps in Finamore pp 111, 137, 146, 156 / Barcadares artefact catalogue in Finamore appendix 2 / Earliest Barcadares artefacts dated 1640-1800 median 1720 n=49 and 1550-1780 median 1665 n=1 /v Finamore appendix 2 / Artifact identification criteria and dates of manufacture came from a number of sources, but the most commonly utilized include Noel Hume [NoÃ«l Hume, Guide to artifacts of colonial America, New York: Vintage Books, 1991] for a range of eighteenth-century artifact categories, and Beaudry and Mrozowski [Beaudry and Mrozowski eds, Interdisciplinary investigations of the Boott Mills Lowell Mass., vol 3 subtitled The boardinghouse system as a way of life, series Cultural resources management 21, Boston: Natl Park Service N Atlantic Reg Office, 1989; cf appendix E] for more refined dates of the nineteenth-century ceramics.
