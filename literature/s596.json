They remarked, that this trade was not less necessary than lucrative and beneficial to the British dominions, by reason of the great encouragement it gives to our seamen and shipping. All this we owe to the Bucaniers, who first established a settlement here, and maintained their ground against a continual annoyance of the Spaniards, though unsupported all the time by any assistance from Great-Britain.",
